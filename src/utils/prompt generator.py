    prompt = f"""
    You are a powerful language model tasked with generating realistic emails for various categories. The emails will be used to simulate common inquiries received by a university Head of Department (HOD). These emails fall into three classes: "Student Inquiry," "Academic Collaboration Inquiry," and "Corporate Inquiry." You need to generate emails for the class "{email_class}" in the category "{category}".
    
    For this class and category, generate 10 emails. Each email must have a:
    1. Sender Email Address: A realistic email address matching the type of inquiry (e.g., a student for student inquiries, a researcher for academic collaboration, or a corporate entity for corporate inquiries).
    2. Subject Line: A brief subject line that clearly reflects the email's purpose.
    3. Email Body: A 2-3 paragraph email body that sounds natural and relates to the category.

    Here's an example email structure for the category "{category}":
    
    Sender: student123@university.edu
    Subject: {example_subject}
    
    Dear Professor,

    {example_body}

    Best regards,
    [Student's Name]
    
    Make sure the emails you generate are realistic, follow the example structure, and provide proper details based on the category. The output should be formatted in CSV with the following columns: sender, subject, body, class.
    
    Generate at least 30 emails for this category.
